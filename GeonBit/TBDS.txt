TBD BEFORE RELEASE:

1. fix GPU skinned animated model.
2. the GetMaterials() and GetMaterial in resources manager - should be model extending function.
3. Extended math - maybe we can put it inside the regular MonoGame math.
4. ModelUtils - can be removed completely, and functions moved to be inside Model (extending it)
5. finish cookbook and examples.
6. finish template.

NOT NOW:
1. GPU particles.
2. Solve the GPU meshed animation.
4. Add to readme chapter about a "cookbook" eg "how to do stuff" - how to use sprites, how to use materials, how to create animated object, etc.
5. Spritesheet animations?

Maybes:
1. Lights!

Nope:
3. Create a 'framework' namespace with proxies to vector, effect, etc. <-- ??
no can do, its all sealed types.
