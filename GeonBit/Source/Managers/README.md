# Managers

Managers are high-level entities, usually singletons, that provide utilities and / or public API around a specific subject.
For example, the TimeManager manager provide helper functions to manage and use game time.

The Managers in this folder are the core managers, eg built-in stuff that are integral part of GeonBit.
